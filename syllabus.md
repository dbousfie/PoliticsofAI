## Prerequisite(s):

Unless you have either the requisites for this course or written special
permission from your Dean to enroll in it, you may be removed from this
course and it will be deleted from your record. This decision may not be
appealed. You will receive no adjustment to your fees in the event that
you are dropped from a course for failing to have the necessary
prerequisites.

## Introduction: 

This course examines the intersection of technology with political
dynamics, focusing on critical areas such as ethics in AI, algorithmic
bias, data manipulation, online activism, big data, gender, race and
identity online, digital security, environmental tech, labor in the
digital economy, genetics and digital health, privacy vs. surveillance,
hybrid warfare, and digital diplomacy. It seeks to understand how these
technological aspects impact policy, democracy, and societal norms.
Through this lens, the course offers insights into the evolving role of
AI in shaping public policy, ethical considerations, and regulatory
responses.

## Learning Objectives:

1\. Identify the relevant actors involved in the development,
governance, and regulation of key political technologies.

2\. Evaluate significant events or issues related to the impact of
technology on politics.

3\. Gain historical context on technological innovations and their
subsequent regulation.

4\. Analyze the impact of technology on public policy, focusing on
ethical considerations and regulatory responses to digital challenges.

5\. Critically evaluate the role of AI tools, such as large language
models (LLMs), in academic and professional contexts.

6\. Develop and justify frameworks for the ethical and effective
integration of LLMs in writing and research.

7\. Design and apply self-assessment rubrics to academic work, ensuring
accountability and alignment between planning and execution.

8\. Engage with academic literature to inform decisions about the use
and assessment of AI tools in research and writing.

## For all written work in this course: 

This course requires a minimum of 2500 words of academic prose to meet
university requirements for 3000-level half courses.

## Paragraph structure 

Basic paragraph structure is an important part of writing. Failure to
use basic paragraph structure will result in repetitive, unstructured,
illogical arguments. Paragraphs help to structure our thought, our
ability to make claims and provide a framework for writing. The topic
sentence and concluding sentence of each paragraph should be in your own
voice (no direct references, quotations or citations). A basic paragraph
structure should follow this template:

- Topic/introduction, in one or two sentences and has an argumentative
  sentence that avoids description, and has a clear political thesis

- Major point with factual evidence, one or two sentences (one sentence
  with ***relevant*** academic citation and one sentence explaining the
  relevance in your own words, demonstrating individual voice and
  reflection)

- Major point with factual evidence, one or two sentences (one sentence
  with ***relevant*** academic citation and one sentence explaining the
  relevance in your own words, demonstrating individual voice and
  reflection)

- Major point with factual evidence, one or two sentences (one sentence
  with ***relevant*** academic citation and one sentence explaining the
  relevance in your own words, demonstrating individual voice and
  reflection)

- Summarizing sentence of overall significance to the overarching thesis
  of the paper and

- Concluding sentence which restates topic sentence and bridges to next
  paragraph.

Failure to use basic paragraph structure throughout your work will
result in the inability to receive full marks.

These paragraph formatting requirements are not arbitrary. There is a
specific reason that I want you to use peer-reviewed academic sources, a
MINIMUM of THREE DIFFERENT ACADEMIC SOURCES per paragraph. WHY?

- First, the difference between opinion and argument is the provision of
  evidence.

- Second, for an academic argument to have veracity, it needs to have an
  arm\'s length perspective, it needs to draw on peer-reviewed sources
  because individual interpretation is prone to error.

- Next, if we have more than one academic source per paragraph if one of
  those sources is weak or questionable the other two will supplement
  it.

- Moreover, multiple sources prevent summary or representation of
  someone else\'s ideas as your own, if you must interpret multiple data
  sources.

- Finally, academic sources have explanatory frameworks that link them
  to underlying theoretical concepts and ideas. News sources, data
  points, and journalism provide evidence without analysis, academic
  work provides analysis with evidence. If you don\'t have that
  consistently throughout your writing, you are going to run into
  problems of the veracity of your claims because they lack
  substantiation.

If any of your sentences, paragraphs, or quotations lack a specific
foundation, you will not receive credit for those submissions.

Lack of data is a lack of foundation. In the era of LLMs, inaccurate
citations will be treated as no citation at all. LLMs routinely
summarize sources without accessing the underlying data. **Failure to
directly quote sources with quotation marks followed by an explanation
in your own words will constitute a lack of sufficient citation.**
**Paraphrasing is no longer sufficient justification for including a
citation**; you must use specific and precise language, including nouns
(specific people, places, and things), as generalized summaries of
sources are often hallucinated, inaccurate, and incomplete when
suggested by LLMs.\
\
Weasel words---vague or evasive language that obscures
meaning---undermine thesis-driven political arguments by avoiding clear
claims and weakening the connection between evidence and position. As
Theodore Roosevelt warned in 1916, they drain content from statements
like a weasel empties an egg: the form remains, but the substance is
gone. In political science, precision matters. Ambiguity dilutes
argument.

Why are weasel words proliferating?

- LLMs avoid strong claims to minimize liability, leading to weasel
  words.

- They replicate academic tone through pattern-matching, not reasoning,
  producing vague phrasing.

- They favor generalizations to ensure broad applicability and avoid
  exclusion.

- They use soft language to evade controversy or implied stance.

- Their training data overrepresents cautious, formulaic academic prose.

- They default to description over argument due to lack of critical
  capacity.

## General information about missed coursework

Students must familiarize themselves with the *University Policy on
Academic Consideration -- Undergraduate Students in First Entry
Programs* posted on the Academic Calendar:

<https://www.uwo.ca/univsec/pdf/academic_policies/appeals/academic_consideration_Sep24.pdf>,

This policy does not apply to requests for Academic Consideration
submitted for **attempted or completed work**, whether online or in
person.

The policy also does not apply to students experiencing longer-term
impacts on their academic responsibilities. These students should
consult [Accessible
Education](http://academicsupport.uwo.ca/accessible_education/).

For procedures on how to submit Academic Consideration requests, please
see the information posted on the Office of the Registrar's webpage:

<https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/>

All requests for Academic Consideration must be made within 48 hours
after the assessment date or submission deadline.

All Academic Consideration requests must include supporting
documentation; however, recognizing that formal documentation may not be
available in some extenuating circumstances, the policy allows students
to make [one]{.underline} Academic Consideration request **without
supporting documentation** in this course. However, the following
assessments are excluded from this, and therefore always require formal
supporting documentation:

Term Assignment

When a student *[mistakenly]{.underline}* submits their
[one]{.underline} allowed Academic Consideration request **without
supporting documentation** for the assessments listed above or those in
the **Coursework with Assessment Flexibility** section below, [the
request cannot be recalled and reapplied]{.underline}. This privilege is
forfeited.

Coursework with Assessment Flexibility

By policy, instructors may deny Academic Consideration requests for the
following assessments with built-in flexibility.

Flexible Completion assignments:

Weekly participation. This course has 12 weekly participation
assignments, and the 10 quizzes with the highest marks are counted
towards your final grade. Should extenuating circumstances arise,
students do not need to request Academic Consideration for the first 2
missed weekly participations. Academic consideration requests will be
denied for the first 2 missed weekly participation assignments.

Religious Accommodation

When conflicts with a religious holiday that requires an absence from
the University or prohibits certain activities, students should request
an accommodation for their absence in writing to the course instructor
and/or the Academic Advising office of their Faculty of Registration.
This notice should be made as early as possible but not later than two
weeks prior to the writing or the examination (or one week prior to the
writing of the test).

Please visit the Diversity Calendars posted on our university's EDID
website for the recognized religious holidays:

All required papers may be subject to submission for textual similarity
review to the commercial plagiarism detection software under license to
the University for the detection of plagiarism. All papers submitted for
such checking will be included as source documents in the reference
database for the purpose of detecting plagiarism of papers subsequently
submitted to the system. Use of the service is subject to the licensing
agreement, currently between The University of Western Ontario and
Turnitin.com ([http://www.turnitin.com](http://www.turnitin.com/)).

## Weekly Participation -- (Weekly submissions) 

Weekly Assignments -- Base submission is pass/fail 70% (17.5 of 25)

Students **must** complete a minimum of **two engagement options
weekly** (Monday 12:01 am - Sunday 11:59 pm) to fulfill participation
requirements. Quizzes can be completed each week for one participation
mark.Tiktoks can be done each week but do not count towards your word count for the course. The remaining written forms of participation can only be done twice each during the entire course (i.e. you can only do 2 policy briefs summaries per semester). You can collaborate with peers on submissions, but they must be submitted individually. You must adopt 5 different forms of written participation throughout the course to build your portfolio and prevent rote production of participation if you planning to do the in-person exam.   A total of 10 weeks of participation
is required, allowing students to skip 2 weeks (e.g., weeks 1 and 12).
Completing 10 weeks fulfills the full 70%. If you are submitting the
same assignment for a second time, make sure to address 'What did I do
differently this week?'

Weekly Engagement Options (a minimum of two options required per week): 

1. Brightspace Lesson Quiz Completion 
 Complete the 2 lesson quizzes in the ‘Tests & Quizzes’ section. These quizzes are pass/fail; only completion is counted, not quiz score. Each quiz counts for one participation mark. In-class exercises can also count for participation but are unlikely to help you achieve your word count requirements. 

2. Written Responses (250 words per lesson)  

Written Responses (250 words per lesson): A reflective analysis engaging with lesson ideas and concepts from lectures, readings, or both. This is not a summary but a critical engagement that links material to current Canada US relations. Proper essay paragraph structure and intext citations are required where applicable. You must reference the course readings at least three times per week to get maximum grades. Submissions not meeting these standards are ineligible for full credit. Each written response counts for one participation mark. See detailed criteria below. 

Other formatting of the 250 words from this list: https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/Assessment-AI-Strategies excluding: True/False Questions, Quiz, Exams and Tests, Fill-in-the-Blank Questions, Close Reading with Questions, Diagram or Image-Based Questions, Summary. If you have any questions, please contact the instructor about the viability of your participation. 

3. Video Responses (does not count towards your total word count) 
 A short (TikTok-style) video exploring a key academic issue from each lesson’s content, suitable for a general audience. Videos must reference at least one academic, peer-reviewed source from our reading list and can be uploaded to Brightspace each week (or linked if hosted elsewhere). Public posting is not required. Each video counts for one participation mark. 

> Sample weekly participation submission:![Picture 565367195, Picture,
> Picture](/media/image2.png){width="4.989583333333333in"
> height="1.78125in"}

A Final calculation activity is **required** to receive your
participation mark.

At the end of the course students just need to calculate their
participation based on the submissions each week throughout the course.
We will take your top 10 weeks.\
\
2 forms of participation per week = 70% (pass/fail)\
\
More than 2 forms of participation each week, or substantive improvement
can result in a higher grade (the 80, 85 and 90 grades below are
approximations, I withhold the right to assess the quality of the
submission and adjust the grade accordingly). You should be able to
demonstrate your responses to my feedback, engaging with different
course material each week to demonstrate improvement throughout the
course. See Brightspace for an example of how to calculate your
participation grade.\
\
Attendance Bonus (5% on Final Exam)

Students will receive a 1% bonus on their final exam grade for every two
classes attended (attendance must be recorded through the Microsoft form
each week during class time), with a maximum of 10 classes considered to
earn the full 5% bonus. You can check your participation through the
link in Brightspace weekly. You cannot receive more than 100% on the
final exam.

## Term Assignment: (requires documentation for an academic consideration)

### Option 1 -- Paired Debate 

Students must sign up on the link in OWL by the end of week 3 for the
debate or essay proposal or they forfeit their grade.

In teams of two ONLY, students should pick a specific issue to the
politics of AI related to their area of interest in Week one. The debate
should outline the key issues from two opposing sides and points of
contention and present each side coherently and convincingly to the
class.

The debate should likely be framed in ethical or regulatory responses to
contemporary issues in the politics of AI. The responses should try to
take two different sides. MAXIMUM 5 MINUTES.\
The presentation should highlight:\
1. Key actors involved\
2. Relevant context or history related to the issue\
3. Claims and evidence put forward on both side\
4. Likely or actual outcome of the issue and the trajectory of the
relations moving forward

Students will need to upload their presentation in an accessible and
clear format (such as a series of tiktoks back and forth, youtube, etc)
for each week they sign up. Students must present on the week they sign
up or else they forfeit their grade. Students are encouraged to think
creatively about how they will present the debate and presentations may
take alternative formats as long as they accomplish the requirements
outlined above. In order to receive an individual mark, students must
upload a short (200 word) summary of their role in the debate
preparation and execution, assessing their groups' strengths and
weaknesses in OWL under 'Assignments'. All written work must use proper
essay paragraph structure and conform to the 'criteria for the
evaluation of written assignments' below or it cannot achieve full
grades.

### Option 2 - Media Assessment

Due at the end of Week 7. This assignment will critically engage with a
movie or documentary that deals with AI, technology and politics. A list
of acceptable material is available on the course webpage, and all media
must have sufficient levels of academic-based argumentation from our
class to warrant its use. All media assessments must have prior approval
of the instructor and must be signed up on the course website at least 2
weeks before it is handed in. The media assessment must critically
engage with the content of the movie for its use in our understand of
the course material, as well as base arguments in academic research and
debates. You should assess the media for its arguments about technology,
and the viability of the arguments given the academic debates on the
issue. The assignment should be a minimum of 1000 words, in proper essay
format (with title page and bibliography) and have a minimum of 4
academic sources, drawing primarily from course readings. All written
work must use proper essay paragraph structure and conform to the
'criteria for the evaluation of written assignments' in the course
syllabus or it cannot achieve full grades.

## Option 3: LLM assignment

Proposal for Final Paper Format and Rubric Development

Students will research and propose the format for their final essay or
policy analysis on AI regulation or politics, with a focus on the
acceptable integration of large language models (LLMs). The proposal
must include a detailed rubric for assessing the final paper and an
explanation of how it will be applied.

Required Proposal Components:

1.  **Acceptable Use of LLMs:**

- Define the role of LLMs in the writing process, specifying which
  aspects (e.g., research, drafting, editing) may involve AI-generated
  content.

- Determine how much \"human in the loop\" involvement is required and
  justify this balance using at least three course readings.

- Address ethical considerations, including issues like originality,
  academic integrity, and critical thinking.

2.  **Assessment Rubric:**

- Create a clear and detailed rubric for evaluating the final essay,
  including measurable categories such as originality, critical
  engagement with course readings, clarity and coherence of argument,
  transparency in LLM usage, and adherence to ethical guidelines.

- Define weightings for each category (e.g., originality 30%, critical
  engagement 25%, transparency 20%, etc.).

- Include specific descriptors for performance levels (e.g., excellent,
  satisfactory, needs improvement), and what would be necessary for each
  grading criteria.

3.  **Justification and Deployment:**

- Explain how the rubric will be applied to assess the final paper and
  why it is an effective tool for measuring academic performance in the
  context of LLM integration.

- Justify the rubric's design with evidence from at least three course
  readings.

- The proposal should be 1000-1250 words, written in essay format, with
  proper citations and a bibliography. **Due at the end of Week 7.**

## Option 4: Community Engaged Learning 

A few students will have the option of participating in a Community
Engaged Learning (CEL) opportunity with an offsite organization involved
in politics of AI issues. Students must submit an application in-class
for the opportunity to participate and will be graded on their
completion of the online-check in with the student success center, their
successful completion of their placement and a short (750 word)
reflective summary that links their work with the CEL to class content.
The reflection is just about how you felt about it in the beginning,
middle and end and how your expectations changed over time. I am looking
for reflection, if you can link to course themes that would be great,
but I am really assessing reflection in general. It shouldn\'t be too
long - I feel the CEL placement is the bulk of the work, it is really
just an expanded version of the logs with some reflection on what
happened, how your expectations changed and what you would say to
someone who wanted to do it next year (i.e. 4-5 double spaced pages).
All written work must use proper essay paragraph structure and conform
to the 'criteria for the evaluation of written assignments' below or it
cannot achieve full grades.

## Option 5: not encouraged - Essay Proposal 

Students must sign up for the essay proposal by the end of Week 3 on the
link in Brightspace or they forfeit their grade.

Students will produce a 1000--1250-word description, excluding
references (250 words per page), of the area of interest for their
study, due by the end of Week 7. The assignment should highlight the
area of interest of your research; the relevant ethical, social,
political, or economic implications of AI; the analytical framework or
method that you will analyze as most fruitful; as well as a list of
potential sources that are directly relevant to your area of interest
(potential issues, gaps, or problems with this list can be addressed in
the assignment). The assignment must be in proper formal essay format
(no bullet points, short form, or colloquial language), should use
subheadings to identify key issues, use proper citation, and should NOT
INCLUDE ANY FORM OF ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY. Dictionaries, encyclopedias,
and Wikipedia should not be used, and use of web material is subject to
instructor's prior approval.

All written work must use proper essay paragraph structure and conform
to the 'criteria for the evaluation of written assignments' below or it
cannot achieve full grades. A basic structure for the assignment would
be:

1.  Title that clearly answers the question for your topic. List of
    approved topics is available in Brightspace.

2.  The assignment should highlight the area of interest of your
    research; the relevant ethical, social, political, or economic
    implications of AI; and how your essay will answer the assigned
    question from the approved essay topic list.

3.  A clear and explicit explanatory response to the question based on
    your topic (i.e., your thesis). You must explain the implications of
    AI governance, regulation, or its societal impacts in the context of
    your topic. Pre-approved questions are here; they must be answered
    to complete the assignment.

4.  Three key distinct arguments with evidence in support of the thesis.
    You must follow the paragraph structure and citation format in the
    course outline. The essay topics should deal with some aspect of AI
    governance, a specific case study (either historical or ongoing),
    and a clear perspective in the essay on why the topic matters given
    class discussion.

5.  The paper MUST reference at least three of the specific theoretical
    frameworks, governance models, or ethical considerations discussed
    throughout the course. Failure to cite a minimum of three
    course-related sources will result in a failure to achieve full
    grades. Substantive engagement with the course materials is also
    required; a failure to integrate the course readings will limit your
    ability to get full grades.

6.  A complete list of all sources used in the paper (i.e., your
    bibliography) as well as accurately and properly cited academic
    material throughout. This may include non-academic sources, but
    there must be a minimum of 4 academic, peer-reviewed sources (and
    they should cover at least three different themes in your work),
    with an emphasis on course material.

7.  All written work must use proper essay paragraph structure and
    conform to the 'criteria for the evaluation of written assignments'
    below or it cannot achieve full grades.

Essay, Policy Analysis OR LLM assignment (part 2) (If Chosen)

### **35% of Final Grade -- Major Essay or Policy Analysis** Due in OWL at the end of **Week 10. The instructor may require that 10% of randomly selected students will have to meet to discuss their paper after completion to ensure there has been no improper LLM use.**

#### **Option One: Traditional Essay or Policy Analysis**

The final draft of the paper should be 8 pages (2000 words) in length
(excluding the bibliography) and must be presented in proper scholarly
format. Students will write a major research paper (based primarily on
academic sources) on a topic of their choice, to be arrived at in
consultation with the instructor. Essay topics should be chosen by Week
6. The essay will choose a pre-approved topic and explicitly address an
ethical, social, or regulatory challenge related to AI using a specific
theoretical framework or approach discussed in the course. The
assignment must be in proper formal essay format (no bullet points,
short form, or colloquial language; can use subheadings to identify
sections; use proper citation; and should NOT INCLUDE ANY FORM OF
ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY). Dictionaries, encyclopedias, and Wikipedia
should not be used, and use of web material is subject to the
instructor's prior approval. A basic structure for the essay will
include:

- **Title, topic, and thesis question or area of interest for potential
  research**. Preapproved topics and approaches are here.

- **A framework for analysis related to the ethical, social, or
  regulatory challenge**. The framework will provide the explanatory
  foundation of the thesis.

- **Three key distinct arguments with evidence in support of the
  thesis**. Follow the paragraph structure in the course outline. The
  data should primarily come from course readings, the pre-approved
  suggested readings, and the suggested texts. Students must engage with
  at least four course texts to complete the assignment, and the
  majority of academic sources (50% + 1) should come from the required
  and optional readings in the course outline.

- **A conclusion that mirrors your title, topic, and thesis question**.
  Rewrite your introduction after you have written your conclusion. Your
  conclusion should provide the clear foundation that you have
  established throughout the essay to demonstrate the validity of your
  thesis. Therefore, your thesis and conclusion should match one
  another. Failure to have consistent argumentation will result in the
  inability to achieve full grades.

- **Properly cited research**. In-text citation is preferred
  (author-date system, as outlined below in 'guidelines for success in
  class'). There should be no proxy URLs (<https://www.lib.uwo.ca/>), no
  search URLs (<http://search.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/>), or
  Dropbox URLs (<https://www.dropbox.com/>). Citations need to be
  consistently formatted, readily available, in English, with precise
  page numbers (no inclusion of p.23-44 or consistent citation across
  pages, i.e., p.118-119). Lack of data is a lack of foundation. In the
  era of LLMs, inaccurate citations will be treated as no citation at
  all. LLMs routinely summarize sources without accessing the underlying
  data. Failure to directly quote sources with quotation marks followed
  by an explanation in your own words will constitute a lack of
  sufficient citation. Paraphrasing is no longer sufficient
  justification for including a citation; you must use specific and
  precise language, including nouns (specific people, places, and
  things), as generalized summaries of sources are often hallucinated,
  inaccurate, and incomplete when suggested by LLMs.

- **A title page** with your name, a title for your paper that reflects
  the thesis and topic of your paper, the date of submission, and the
  course number on it. If you cannot clearly and simply identify the
  title and topic of your paper, it is often an indicator of a lack of
  focus.

- Papers submitted before the deadline can revise and resubmit the
  assignment. For details on revision and resubmission, see the 'revise
  and resubmit' tab in Brightspace.

- The Department's rules regarding plagiarism and the submission of
  similar essays to two or more different instructors are appended to
  this course outline and should be noted. (See 'Criteria for Evaluation
  of Written Assignments' below). Students must submit their papers
  through OWL, and all papers may be processed by Turnitin. Papers
  submitted after deadlines (including excused late papers) will be
  marked, but comments will not be provided.

#### **Option Two: AI Policy Analysis or Essay and Rubric Implementation**

(Available only to students who completed the LLM Term Proposal
Assignment)

Students will write a full policy analysis or essay on a topic related
to AI regulation or politics, adhering strictly to the format, LLM usage
guidelines, and assessment rubric outlined in their proposal.

**Requirements:**

- **Adherence to Proposed Format:** Students must follow the LLM
  integration process specified in their proposal and document its usage
  (e.g., annotated drafts, reflective notes, or appendices demonstrating
  AI input and human intervention).

- **Topic Scope:** Engage critically with a policy or regulatory issue
  related to AI, incorporating at least six academic sources, including
  three from course readings.

- **Rubric Implementation:**

  - Submit the final paper with the rubric from the proposal applied as
    a self-assessment.

  - Include a reflective commentary (500-750 words) explaining how the
    essay meets the rubric criteria and how LLM integration enhanced or
    constrained the writing process.

  - The instructor will use the same rubric for grading, ensuring
    consistency.

- **Length:** Approximately 2000 words, excluding the reflective
  commentary and appendices.

- **Late Penalty:** A penalty of 5% per day (to a maximum of 5 days)
  will apply to late submissions unless an extension is arranged in
  advance. Late submissions (even excused) may not receive detailed
  feedback.

### Final paper requirements 

The final draft of the paper should be 8 pages (2000 words) in length
(excluding the bibliography) and must be presented in proper scholarly
format. See the *Criteria for Evaluation of Written Assignments* and the
*Essay Evaluation Checklist* for a detailed description of the essay
requirements. All written work must use proper essay paragraph structure
and conform to the 'criteria for the evaluation of written assignments'
below or it cannot achieve full grades.

## Summative Assignment 10% (if chosen)

Due at the end of Week 11. Minimum 2500 words required. The summative
assignment is only available to students who have completed a minimum of
2000 words of weekly responses throughout the course. If chosen,
students must also write the 40% in person final exam. The summative
assessment follows the guidelines of the weekly participation final
calculation. It must include every weekly participation submission as
well as a short 250-500 word reflective summary demonstrating clear
engagement with course materials throughout the course as well as
reflection and development of critical thinking throughout the course.
It is not available to students who complete less than 2000 words of
written work in their weekly participation.

## Final Exam 

15 or 40 % of final course grade. To be scheduled during the exam
period.

The final exam will be cumulative (i.e., will be based on the material
covered in lectures, assigned readings, and discussions throughout the
whole of the course). The exam may include both a short
answer/identification component and questions requiring longer,
essay-style responses. A choice of answers and an exam preparation guide
may be given. The examination requires a breadth of use of the course
readings, examination answers that reference one or two readings fail to
demonstrate breadth and cannot achieve full marks regardless of any
other criteria. All written work must use proper essay paragraph
structure and conform to the 'criteria for the evaluation of written
assignments' below or it cannot achieve full grades.

# Zoom Etiquette

1.  Please pay attention to video, microphone and screensharing
    settings. Keep chat rooms and images appropriate for an academic
    setting. Any inappropriate actions, imagery, discussion or chat
    messages may result in your removal from the meeting at my
    discretion. Audio recordings may be available as an alternative to
    synchronous discussion.

2.  Please test all WIFI, video and audio before the meetings. Zoom
    buttons for raising your hand, responding yes and no, asking host to
    adjust speed, requesting a break and more.

3.  Please be conscious of your speaking time and that of others, if you
    are continuing in a manner that is not fair to your peers, I reserve
    the right to intervene and put us back on a more focused discussion.

# Recording synchronous content (office hours or other meetings)

Any remote learning sessions for this course **may** be recorded. The
data captured during these recordings may include your image, voice
recordings, chat logs and personal identifiers (name displayed on the
screen). The recordings may be used for educational purposes related to
this course, including evaluations. The recordings may be disclosed to
other individuals participating in the course for their private or group
study purposes. Please contact the instructor if you have any concerns
related to session recordings. Participants in this course are not
permitted to record the sessions, except where recording is an approved
accommodation, or the participant has the prior written permission of
the instructor.

# Meeting the Requirements of the Assignment: 

All written work must be submitted on time, must be of the appropriate
length, must use the required number and type of resources, and, most
importantly, must address the issues or questions posed in the
assignment. All work must have sufficient academic content and sources
related to our course or else it cannot receive full marks.

# Non-medical and medical accommodation

Non-medical absences from class, late essays or assignments, will be
subject to a 10% penalty per day (weekends included). All assignments
must be completed to receive course credit. Further information is found
in the Policy on Accommodation for Medical Illness
(<https://studentservices.uwo.ca/secure/index.cfm>).

Accommodation for medical illness of work worth less than 10% of the
total course grade will require medical documentation. If documentation
is required for either medical or non-medical academic accommodation,
then such documentation must be submitted directly to the appropriate
Faculty Dean\`s office and [not]{.underline} to the instructor. Only the
Dean\`s office can determine if accommodation is warranted.

# Statement on Academic Offences

Scholastic offences are taken seriously, and students are directed to
read the appropriate policy, specifically, the definition of what
constitutes a Scholastic Offence, at the following Web site:
<http://www.uwo.ca/univsec/handbook/appeals/scholastic_discipline_undergrad.pdf>
.

"All required papers may be subject to submission for textual similarity
review to the commercial plagiarism detection software under license to
the University for the detection of plagiarism. All papers submitted for
such checking will be included as source documents in the reference
database for the purpose of detecting plagiarism of papers subsequently
submitted to the system. Use of the service is subject to the licensing
agreement, currently between The University of Western Ontario and
Turnitin.com ( <http://www.turnitin.com> )."

## Guidelines for Success in Class

Since there seldom are definitive answers to the questions we will be
asking about the politics of AI, and much of what you will learn in this
course will be enhanced by the ideas and perspectives of your
colleagues. But for this to work, everyone must participate fully and
constructively. Be mindful of the following points, and you will be
successful:

- Come to all classes having read the assigned readings for that week
  and prepared to participate in discussion. It is useful to remember
  that some week's readings may be more comfortable relevant to your
  research interests than others and focusing on readings that are most
  salient to your interests will ensure maximum usefulness in the
  course.

- Participate in discussions, but do not over-participate. Everyone must
  be given an opportunity to take part in discussions. Constructive
  participation involves the raising of *relevant* points and ideas.
  Online participation will be considered as well in participation
  marks.

- Demonstrate respect for the ideas presented by others at all times.
  This is essential to open discussion and the free exchange of ideas.
  This does not mean that you must agree with others. Informal debate
  will teach you even more about your own position while simultaneously
  exposing you to different viewpoints. Make use of such opportunities,
  but no disrespectful behavior will be tolerated.

# Criteria for the evaluation of written assignments

## Paragraph structure 

Basic paragraph structure is an important part of writing. Failure to
use basic paragraph structure will result in repetitive, unstructured,
illogical arguments. Paragraphs help to structure our thought, our
ability to make claims and provide a framework for writing. The topic
sentence and concluding sentence of a paragraph should be in your own
voice (no direct references). A basic paragraph structure should follow
this template:

Topic sentence one or two lines

Major point with evidence one or two lines

Major point with evidence one or two lines

Major point with evidence one or two lines

Summarizing sentence of overall significance to the overarching thesis
of the paper

Concluding sentence which restates topic sentence and bridges to next
paragraph.

Failure to use basic paragraph structure throughout your work will
result in the inability to receive full marks.

## Quotations

Quotations longer than 4 lines should be indented. Try to avoid
quotations longer than 4 lines. Assume that I do not read an indented
4-line quotation and make sure the sentence immediately following the
quotation summarizes its significance to your argument in your own
words. Never include quotations or sources in your introduction or
conclusion, your introduction and conclusion should outline the paper
structure in your own words.

## Citations and Bibliography

We will use the author date system. It keeps footnotes and endnotes to a
minimum.

- Text references will be short with the Surname, Date and page number
  (i.e. Žižek 2002: 342).

- Use this formatting everywhere, including sources from our reading
  list and in the response papers and any written work.

- Works by the same author in the same year should be cited as Žižek
  2002a, Žižek2002b, etc.

- Et al. can be used by sources with three or more authors. The full
  list must be in the bibliography.

- If you have more than one source in the same sentence you just include
  them with a semi-colon in chronological order i.e (Žižek 2002: 345;
  D'Amelio 2018: 212; Swift 2020: 445)

## Bibliography 

A bibliography must be included in all written work, it should include
the complete details of the work and included an 'Accessed' date if it
is an online source.

hyperpartisan news.\" Social Science Computer Review 37.1 (2019): 38-54.

online political micro-targeting in Europe.\" Internet Policy Review 8.4

taxes." The Nation, October 17, 2017,

Accessed August 1, 2020.

Gill, Stephen. \"Transnational class formations, European crisis and the
silent revolution.\" Critical Sociology 43.4-5 (2017): 641.

## Analytical Content and Paragraph structure:

Higher grades will be given to work that demonstrates the ability to
interpret, critically assess and develop insights of the material. To
determine whether or not your argument is analytical, ask yourself \"Am
I demonstrating to the reader my insights in an academic way?" If you
are simply summarizing or describing in detail phenomena, your work is
unlikely to have high analytical content.

*Helpful signs you are not developing analytical content: Excessive
quotes; beginning or ending a paragraph with a quote; short (fewer than
4 sentences) paragraphs; no sources in a long paragraph; lack of similar
argument in introduction and conclusion.*

## Development of an Argument:

Higher grades will be given to work that has a clearly stated argument
and a set of logically developed and reasonably comprehensive points in
support of that argument. Academic arguments need not be personal
(though in certain instances they can be -- check with the instructor),
rather they demonstrate the logical progression of the position you are
developing. The key here is to attempt to convince your reader of the
soundness or feasibility of your argument. Nuanced arguments recognize
obvious criticisms and seek to address them logically. Consistency of an
argument throughout a paper is important.

*Helpful signs your argument may be in trouble: Using the same author or
quote more than a few times in successive paragraphs; your introduction
and conclusion are not similar; you introduce material in the
introduction and the conclusion that cannot be found elsewhere; you have
quotes in your conclusion; your attempt to address obvious criticisms
contradicts your thesis, you adopt multiple theoretical frameworks; you
cannot find any sources that agree with your central claims.*

## Grammar, Spelling, and Style: 

Higher grades will be given to written work that is grammatically
correct and is clearly and accurately written, while lower grades will
be given to work that is difficult to read or understand due to
excessive grammatical and/or spelling errors.

*While different approaches work for different people, it is recommended
that you try the following every time you have a written assignment:
after completing your assignment, put it away for a while (ideally, for
a few days); when you pick it up again, read it carefully, slowly, and
aloud (when we are familiar with a paper we tend to skim it during
proof-reading, thereby missing errors -- so make sure you are reading it
word for word). Mistakes in grammar may not always look wrong, but they
usually sound wrong. If you need some help with writing style or
grammar, there are many resources available on campus.*

# General

All students must complete all course requirements. Failure to do so
(e.g., by not handing-in an assignment or by missing an examination
without due cause) will subject the student to the appropriate
University regulations. Students must also keep a duplicate copy of
their assignments.

## Policy on communication

I strive to be accessible and responsive to student inquiries. However,
repeated or persistent e-mails/texts/phone calls will overload my
capacity to respond to all students equally. As such, I reserve the
right to answer initial questions but forego multiple responses or
inquires for a 24hour cool-down period. I also may take longer to
respond to communications during non-working hours, holidays, and
weekends. I appreciate your understanding in this matter.

## Late Assignments - Formal Guidelines

Late papers will be accepted but will be subject to a late penalty of 10
per cent per day to a maximum of 5 days, after which they will not be
accepted and a mark of 0 will be recorded. In the interest of fairness
to all students, there will be no exceptions to this unless you have
arranged in advance for an extension. All extensions must be arranged in
advance of the day on which a paper is due**. Papers submitted after
deadlines (including excused late papers) will be marked, but comments
will not be** **provided.**

## Policy on Children in the classroom[^1]

"It is my belief that if we want women in academia, that we should also
expect children to be present in some form. Currently, the university
does not have a formal policy on children in the classroom. The policy
described here is thus, a reflection of my own beliefs and commitments
to student, staff and faculty parents.

All exclusively breastfeeding babies are welcome in class as often as is
necessary to support the breastfeeding relationship. Because not all
women can pump sufficient milk, and not all babies will take a bottle
reliably, I never want students to feel like they have to choose between
feeding their baby and continuing their education. You and your nursing
baby are welcome in class anytime.

For older children and babies, I understand that minor illnesses and
unforeseen disruptions in childcare often put parents in the position of
having to choose between missing class to stay home with a child and
leaving him or her with someone you or the child does not feel
comfortable with. While this is not meant to be a long-term childcare
solution, occasionally bringing a child to class in order to cover gaps
in care is perfectly acceptable.

I ask that all students work with me to create a welcoming environment
that is respectful of all forms of diversity, including diversity in
parenting status.

In all cases where babies and children come to class, I ask that you sit
close to the door so that if your little one needs special attention and
is disrupting learning for other students, you may step outside until
their need has been met. Non-parents in the class, please reserve seats
near the door for your parenting classmates.

Finally, I understand that often the largest barrier to completing your
coursework once you become a parent is the tiredness many parents feel
in the evening once children have finally gone to sleep. The struggles
of balancing school, childcare and often another job are exhausting! I
hope that you will feel comfortable disclosing your student-parent
status to me. This is the first step in my being able to accommodate any
special needs that arise. While I maintain the same high expectations
for all student in my classes regardless of parenting status, I am happy
to problem solve with you in a way that makes you feel supported as you
strive for school-parenting balance. Thank you for the diversity you
bring to our classroom!"

## Policy on non-service animals in the classroom 

Western University established a [Pets and Therapy Animals policy in May
2020](https://www.uwo.ca/univsec/pdf/policies_procedures/section1/mapp156.pdf)
that limits the presence of pets in campus buildings. Service and
therapy animals are permitted inside all Western locations, in
accordance with accessibility policies, however animals for
companionship are not allowed.

## Religious/Cultural Observance 

Persons who have religious or cultural observances that coincide with
this class should let the instructor know in writing (by e-mail for
example) by Week 4. I strongly encourage you to honor your cultural and
religious holidays! However, if I do not hear from you by Week 4, I will
assume that you plan to attend all class meetings.

## Point of View

The readings, class lectures, and my comments in class will suggest a
particular point of view. This perspective is my own and does not have
to be yours! I encourage you to disagree with the ideas in the readings
and lectures as well as the perspectives of your colleagues in the
course. Please express yourself! A significant part of a university
education is learning about the complexity of various issues; therefore,
it is important that we listen and respect one another but we do not
have to agree. A richer discussion will occur when a variety of
perspectives are presented in class for discussion.

## Academic Sources

A key aspect of the university experience is developing your ability to
assess the validity of sources. Academic sources such as those found on
Google Scholar should be your primary source of arguments, ideas and
claims made in the course. While it may be appropriate to provide
anecdotal, non-academic, news, theories from outside the academy as data
points, all arguments must be situated in triangulated academic
research. By triangulation (you may see a ∆ on your assignments) this is
the idea that academic peer review provides a foundation for the
veracity of the claims being made. if you rely too heavily on one source
(i.e. that more than 3 footnotes in a row are from the same source) you
may be veering towards summary or plagiarism of that source as it lacks
proper verification from other academics who agree with those
assessments. Moreover, most sources have implicit or explicit
frameworks, understandings, biases which you may not be able to assess
without triangulation. While there is no explicit number of sources
required on assignments, you will be unable to achieve full marks if you
do not have academic arguments with academic sources. This is a standard
expectation of all assignments in this class.

## Discussion Guidelines[^2]

In our structured and unstructured discussions and dialogues, we also
will have many opportunities to explore some challenging, high-stakes
issues and increase our understandings of different perspectives. Our
conversations may not always be easy; we sometimes will make mistakes in
our speaking and our listening; sometimes we will need patience or
courage or imagination or any number of qualities in combination to
engage our texts, our classmates, and our own ideas and experiences.
Always we will need respect for others. Thus, an important secondary aim
of our course necessarily will be for us to increase our facility with
the sometimes-difficult conversations that arise inside issues of social
inequality as we deepen our understandings of multiple perspectives --
whatever our backgrounds, experiences, or positions.

## Policy on the use of LLMs (AI, ChatGPT, Bard, etc) in the classroom **^3^**

Unless otherwise noted during class activities, you may only use ChatGPT
or any other Generative technology to *aid* or *nuance* your thinking,
communication, and learning; but not to *replace* or *subvert* it. See
the table below for some examples of allowable and non-allowable uses of
Generative technology in this class (NOTE: This is not an exhaustive
list of examples). Generative technology may be used to assist in
assessment throughout the course, if you wish to opt out of the use of
generative technology, please let me know.

How generative technology may be used in assessment:

1\. Pre-assessment - to provide structural or overall feedback before
begining any grading.

2\. Applying rubric - using the rubric from the course outline to apply
to submitted assignments to assess the degree of compliance before or
during completing any grading.

3\. During assessment - to double-check the veracity of claims being
made about your submission during the assessment of your material.

4\. Post assessment - to find additional examples or instances in your
submissions to assist in providing feedback.

5\. Refining assessment - suggesting forms of constructive criticism,
actionable items, and overarching themes or issues to assist in your
assessment.

6\. Checking for unauthorized AI use, following University guidelines
(and those attached below).

How generative technology will NOT be used in assessment:

No grades will be assigned solely with generative technology at any
point in this course. Assessment will always be done by the
instructor/graders in accordance with the course outlines, because of
the unpredictability and unreliability of current generative technology.

No personal or individual identifiers will ever be included in the
assessment of material by any generative technology.

This is an Exemplar of what the week 12 participation summary will look like - along with rationale

Participation Q&A
Q: What does it mean to calculate participation?
A: By calculating participation, we minimise unconscious bias, groupthink, and subjective assessment. Participation is assessed on clear, objective evidence. Students present what they’ve done in a way that demonstrates compliance with course expectations, rather than relying on the instructor’s memory or impressions.

Q: Why do you do it this way?
A: The purpose is to reduce unconscious bias and subjectivity in grading. The system is transparent and evidence-based, giving every student the same foundation. Everyone begins with the same base of 70% for completing quizzes + in-class group work each week. Students who go beyond this minimum by producing written work that shows revision and direct citation of weekly readings can move above the 70%.

Q: What counts and what doesn’t?

Counts toward base: Weekly quizzes + in-class group work (top 10 weeks).

Counts toward extra: Written assignments (~250 words each), only if they directly cite the week’s assigned readings (with page numbers) and demonstrate improvement from first to second attempt.

Does not count: Attendance (this is only a bonus toward your exam grade, not participation). Written work without direct citation of readings also does not count toward the extra.

Q: Why evidence?
A: All participation grades must be based on clear evidence (submitted work). This ensures equity is substantive: grades aren’t based on availability to attend, eagerness or interest, or the instructor’s bias, but on objective criteria anyone can meet.

Week 12 — Participation Summary Exemplar (Student Submission)
Student: Jane Doe
Course: POLS 3390F — The Politics of AI
Instructor: Dr. Bousfield
Submission Type: Participation calculation + improvement evidence

A) Participation Calculation
I completed 10 counted weeks with Quiz + In-class Group Work (base requirement) → Base 70% (17.5/25).

To move above 70%, I completed five distinct written formats, each done twice (initial + revised) → 10 written pieces × ~250 words = ~2500 words (all written, no video/podcasts). These are extra forms beyond Quiz + Group Work.

B) Format (written formats only; each format appears twice across the term)

Op-ed (≈250w) → Weeks 2 & 6

Policy memo (≈250w) → Weeks 3 & 7

Case brief (≈250w) → Weeks 4 & 8

Comparative critique (≈250w) → Weeks 5 & 9

Critical synthesis note (≈250w) → Weeks 10 & 11

All five formats are fully written. No summaries, quizzes, or image-based items are used as extra forms. Each revised piece below follows the paragraph template required in course outline.

C) Second Attempts with Improvement Notes

Op-ed — Week 6 (Second Attempt)
Topic: Digital sovereignty and AI security
Improvement demonstrated: Added two direct quotes with page numbers from assigned readings; built a clear thesis in the opening line; used structured evidence/analysis. The first attempt was descriptive; the second ties analysis to course texts.

Policy memo — Week 7 (Second Attempt)
Topic: Ecological “technofixes” and AI’s energy use
Improvement demonstrated: Inserted three short quotes (with page numbers) from readings; connected each to recommendations; added “Implications” section linking evidence to policy choice.

Case brief — Week 8 (Second Attempt)
Case: Labor protections in the gig economy
Improvement demonstrated: Used quotations with page numbers to substantiate precedent; clarified relevance with a final takeaway sentence. First draft lacked sourcing; second anchors claims in course readings.

Comparative critique — Week 9 (Second Attempt)
Comparison: Two scholarly arguments on CRISPR and AI governance
Improvement demonstrated: Juxtaposed three quoted propositions (with page numbers); followed each with explanation; concluded with explicit judgment of stronger framework.

Critical synthesis note — Week 11 (Second Attempt)
Theme: Hybrid warfare and AI-enabled propaganda
Improvement demonstrated: Defined the concept with a direct quote; added two further quotations illustrating causal mechanisms; structured with topic → evidence → conclusion.

Total written words across all formats: ≈ 2500 words

D) Therefore the grade should be:

Base: Top 10 weeks with Quiz + Group Work = 70%.

Above-base justification: Five written formats × two attempts (all written; ~2500 words) + documented improvement in five revised pieces → movement into the 85–90 range, at instructor discretion.

[ file with all submissions attached or linked here ]

If the weekly participation summary is submitted on the day of class there is a 5% bonus (instead of the grade being a base 70, it will be a base 75)

Q: Where do I submit the write-up/response for participation?
A: In Brightspace, click Course Content → select the week → submit under the weekly content section.

Q: If I do the in-class quiz and the online quiz, is that enough for participation?
A: Doing both gives you:

* 75% if submitted the day of class.
* 70% if submitted any time before the next class.

Q: How do I write the written response to the lecture for participation?
A: Use the big list from Waterloo for ideas, but mainly aim for variation in your 250-word responses. The goal is to meet the word limit if you prefer not to write the exam.

Q: Are there discussion questions to respond to, or should it be based on my own thoughts?
A: You can use the questions in the weekly PowerPoint as prompts, or respond based on your own reflections.

Q: Where’s the link to the 250-word participation options?
A: [https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/Assessment-AI-Strategies](https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/Assessment-AI-Strategies)

Q: How many activities do I need to complete each week for 100% participation?
A: You’re graded on improvement across weeks. It’s not enough just to submit—you must show progress. Each format is repeated twice to demonstrate this growth.

Q: Does in-class group work count toward the participation grade?
A: Yes. Weekly participation = half in-class group work + half online quiz. This earns the base 70% (or 75% if submitted on class day).

Q: Where is the link for the different types of writing we can do for participation?
A: [https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/Assessment-AI-Strategies](https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/Assessment-AI-Strategies)

Q: Where do I find the pre-approved media for the term assignment?
A: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1raCddghx5IyRShMGWlQcarJv1V7fjF779FtZHX0Gs58/edit?gid=0#gid=0\&range=H1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1raCddghx5IyRShMGWlQcarJv1V7fjF779FtZHX0Gs58/edit?gid=0#gid=0&range=H1)

Q: Which types of assignments can be repeated each week without limit?
A: Only in-class exercises and online quizzes can be repeated weekly. The 250-word written responses must rotate in format.

Q: how do I specifically sign up for the term assignment?
A: you have to go to the Google sheet here http://tiny.cc/3390 click on the bottom tab that says 'sign up for term assignment here' and put your name on the sheet

People in CEL don't have a set deadline on the term assignment, their reflection is due after the deliverable has being submitted.

People doing the media assessment or the LLM assignment - it is due the end of week 7 (October 29th 11:59 p.m.)

The paired debates can be done on any week up to week 12. They are pre-recorded video debates, you can switch into them at any time (i.e. at the end of week 7 if you're not happy with your choice of media assessment, you could always switch into a paired debate instead and do it any week before week 12).

Q: do I have to do an essay proposal to submit the essay
A: no, the bot has been giving out bad information - an essay proposal is not required for the essay it is one of the optional term assignments

Q: does everyone have to submit an essay
A: no, if you do the second option where you have 10% added to your participation summaries and you have completed 2500 words you do not have to complete the essay

Reading week notification
Just so you know I will look up the page numbers of your citations and will provide a screenshot of the page if there are any errors in your citations. This will be intensified for the essays, because misrepresenting work is academic dishonesty.

The media assessments have been marked, everyone should have a linked file with comments in the docx. If you don't, let me know because that's just a glitch.

Everyone in the course has a 'revise and resubmit' option on written work (excluding weekly participation). Please make sure to review the instructions here https://westernu.brightspace.com/d2l/le/lessons/126015/topics/3263307 and follow them for resubmissions. 

I generally say to work on the essay before you revise and resubmit the term assignment because it is worth more. However, I think people should seriously consider doing the in-person exam rather than the essay, based on the submissions I've seen so far.

Common issues

Citation and paragraph structure. This is the most basic problem that is recurring consistently. The difference between literary writing and academic writing is that we have to provide the evidence for our claims. So I need to see the evidence as direct quotes, and then the sentence immediately following it restating that quote in your own words. Paraphrasing is not sufficient. I can't state that strongly enough. Page numbers are necessary, they will never not be necessary. I will reattach the key part of the course syllabus on paragraphs below.

The 'neutral tool' thesis of technology is a straw man I'm seeing everywhere. Unless someone establishes that it is neutral you are falsely setting something up to knock it down (hence strawman). This was week 1 of the course, it's not a thing, please stop putting it in your arguments.

There are a few particular problems that are popping up in the current framework. They have been outlined extensively here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing , but I will go over the obvious ones.

1.Rhetorical or pithy claims that sound like they have substance but if we have to define concepts in terms of Political Science, they immediately fall apart. You need to define your concepts clearly with academic foundation, this includes key ideas like sovereignty, autonomy, independence and anything relating to power. 'Oppression', 'exclusion' and ' domination' in the abstract are not things - you need specific actors, instances and events of those things happening and why.

2. 'If this, then that' - this rhetorical device is all over peoples writing, it's a common llm practice of putting things together that doesn't actually make any sense but sounds like it does. Reread all of your sentences closely and independently of one another. If you read it aloud and it doesn't make sense, it doesn't make sense.

3. Particularly in the context of the media assessment instead of an argument you will see 'symbolizes', 'imitates' , 'mirrors', 'deepens', 'seen similarily' rather than clearly stated academic thesis that requires substantiation with evidence. If you don't have the appropriate framework the llms will start doing that to try to stick stuff together, that doesn't belong together. Review the approaches from the course - they are literally a requirement of the final exam.

I don't have office hours this week but I can set up individual meetings if necessary.

Best, Dan


Q: does only weekly participation count towards the 2500 necessary words?
A: As long as you hit 2500 words for the term it doesn't matter where they come from - people doing the media assessment will also count for 2500 words.
Tiktoks won't give you the word count, but anything written in essay paragraph format counts, wherever it comes from.
